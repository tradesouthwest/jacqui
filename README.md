## NOTES 

* Only top level (parent) menu items should used in footer. Same with top menu IF you are concerned about touch screens. It is a good place to add social media links as a menu item.
* If a left sidebar layout option is selected, the sidebar will go offcanvas on mobile devices and appear below the mobile menu when the top left icon is clicked.
