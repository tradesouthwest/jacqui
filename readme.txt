== ABOUT JACQUI ==

Supported post formats: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Works perfectly in desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices. For a live demo go to http://themes.tradesouthwest.com/jacqui.

== NOTES ==

* Only top level (parent) menu items should used in footer. Same with top menu IF you are concerned about touch screens. It is a good place to add social media links as a menu item.
* If a left sidebar layout option is selected, the sidebar will go offcanvas on mobile devices and appear below the mobile menu when the top left icon is clicked.
